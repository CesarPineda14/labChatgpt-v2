# Web Content Search Using Langchain and OpenAI Embeddings

This project leverages Langchain, OpenAI embeddings, and Chroma to load, process, and query the content of a webpage. The application extracts text from a given webpage, splits the text into chunks, stores it in a vector index using Chroma, and then generates responses based on a query.

## Project Architecture and Components

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Web Content Loader**:  
   Uses `WebBaseLoader` from Langchain to scrape content from a webpage.
   
2. **Text Splitter**:  
   Splits the loaded content into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to prepare the text for efficient processing.

3. **Chroma Index**:  
   Chroma is used to store the text chunks as embeddings. The embeddings are generated using OpenAI's API through the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class.

4. **Query Processing**:  
   Once the text is split and indexed, the system retrieves relevant documents based on the provided query using Chromaâ€™s vector store and returns an answer based on the most relevant content.

5. **OpenAI Integration**:  
   OpenAI's API key is used for generating embeddings for the content, which allows the system to perform semantic search efficiently.

### Project Flow
1. **Content Loading**:  
   A URL is provided, and the content from the webpage is fetched using `WebBaseLoader`.
   
2. **Text Splitting**:  
   The text is split into smaller chunks (with a size limit of 1000 characters and an overlap of 200 characters).
   
3. **Chroma Indexing**:  
   The split text is converted into embeddings using OpenAI's API, and these embeddings are stored in Chroma's vector store.
   
4. **Querying**:  
   A query is passed to the vector store, and the most relevant chunks of text are retrieved to generate a response.

## Installation and Setup

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CesarPineda14/RAGproject.git
    cd web-content-search
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` should include:

    ```plaintext
    langchain
    langchain-openai
    langchain_chroma
    langchain_community
    langchain_core
    langchain_text_splitters
    openai
    beautifulsoup4
    ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key:

    Replace the placeholder API key in the `create_chroma_index` function:

    ```python
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
    ```

4. Run the application:

    You can run the app by executing:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    Make sure to replace the URL and query in the script as needed.

## Example

In the example below, the script loads content from a Wikipedia page about Artificial Intelligence and queries for the main topic:

```python
url = "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligencia_artificial"
query = "What is the main topic of the website?"
main(url, query)

```

The application will print the relevant response based on the query, which will be extracted from the page content.

# Expected Output:

```csharp
Loading content from https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inteligencia_artificial...
Loaded 1 document(s) from the webpage.
Splitting text into chunks...
Split into 3 chunks.
Creating Chroma index...
Generating response for query: What is the main topic of the website?
Generated Response: 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems...

```
